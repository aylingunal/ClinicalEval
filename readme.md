# Project Overview: Automatic Clinical Notes Evaluation via Preference Learning

Thanks for stopping by! The repository is organized as follows:
- code for running experiments is in pl/, including the various loss functions we experiment with. Instructions on how to navigate the code are in pl/readme.md.
- annotations and notes data are available in data/. The Alex Street transcripts corpus is not included because it requires a license to access.

This work has two main contributions:

1. A dataset of listwise preference annotations: we collect a sample of Alex Street datasets and use 3 LLMs to generate clinical notes based on the sampled transcripts, and a group of MSW students at Fordham University annotate these notes by ranking them and scoring them in different categories. 
(We'll release the notes and annotated rankings of those notes publicly, but you'll need your own way to access the Alex Street dataset for the transcripts. A very small portion of our annotations include the HOPE dataset, which we included to make the lives of our annotators a bit easier; that is publicly available.)

2. Our proposed methodology :) coming soon!
