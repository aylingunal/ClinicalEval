# An Overview of DPO

DPO is covered relatively well online and there are a couple resources I used while working on this project. That being said, it still took quite a while to get comfortable with the details. This document is an amalgamation of my personal notes I took when first diving in, and hopefully it can be helpful for someone else! (That being said, if you notice anything incorrect here, feel free to reach out and let me know so I can update it :))

Before I get started, I'll note existing resources that helped me in my understanding:
- the [original DPO paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18290). It takes a couple reads to get what's fully going on, but I highly recommend it; it has all the information you need (including starter code and an additional derivation for the loss for listwise data in the appendix).
